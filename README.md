# JavaScript--BellyButtonBiodiversity

-For this project, I built an interactive bashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset, which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.
-Highlights of work Done:  

- Extract and transform the crowdfunding.xlsx Excel data to create a category DataFrame, and export the category DataFrame as category.csv and save it to your GitHub repository

- Extract and transform the crowdfunding.xlsx Excel data to create a subcategory DataFrame, and export the subcategory DataFrame as subcategory.csv and save it to your GitHub repository.

- Continue this process creating a campaign and contacts Dataframe and saving it to Github repository


-In conclusion, the dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.
